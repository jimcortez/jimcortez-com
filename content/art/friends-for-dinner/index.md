Friends for Dinner was a placed art piece at Burning Man 2023. Participants experienced a large "fancy" dining room table that invited conversation and inclusion in a familiar place, but in an unfamiliar setting. Using more than 2000 individually-addressable LED's, the piece had hours of unique animations that tied the chandelier, plates, and orbs together.

Special thanks to the crew: Noah, Jay, and Russ
